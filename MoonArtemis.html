    <p> Nasa will use a spacecraft called Orion, to carry crew to lunar orbit where they will transfer into a human landing system or Gateway. In order to get Orion into lunar orbit, the spacecraft will sit upon the most powerful rocket ever created by man. It is said to be 5 times stronger than the Saturn 5 rocket (the most powerful rocket ever created, this rocket was used in Apollo). The name of this rocket is Space Launch System or SLS. </p>
    
    <p>Gate way is a lunar outpost around the Moon. It will host astronuats when they reach lunar orbit using Orion. Gateway will be orbiting the Moon, so when other atronauts come to the Moon, they can reuse this piece of spacecraft.</p>
    
    <p> The Human Landing system will essentially be a Moon Lander. Astronauts will board this using Orion. NASA has currectly asked 3 private companies to come up with their own types of Moon Landers. Space X, Blue Origin, and Dynetics (all privte owned and opperated space companies) are working on their Moon Landers with different ideas. NASA currectly hasn't chosen any Moon Lander yet.</p>
