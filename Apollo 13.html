    <p> The objective for this mission was to land on the Moon and return to Earth. The crew which was suppose complete this objective was Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Everything was going normal for this mission. They had lift off without any problem and everything was fine.
    </p> 
    <p>But suddednly the crew realized that something was wrong with the capsule. They were right, the oxygen tank had been busted (or was leaking). This was the crew air supply, without it, they would suffocate and die. So in order to prevent this from happening, they aborted the mission. They had to turn back home. They used the moon's gravity as a catapult and thus were back on the journey home. Eventually, the crew returned safely. Even though it was a mission abort, scientists in Nasa learned a lot about the moon and how to change the command module to make it more safe for the astronauts.
