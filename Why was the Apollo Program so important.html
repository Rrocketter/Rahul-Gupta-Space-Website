  <body>
    <p>The Apollo Program was very critical to American Government. During the time of the Apollo Program was the Cold War. It was the space age as well as the age to test nuclear bombs.</p> 
    <p>The US was up against the Soviet Union (USSR). Both countries realized that if they go to war and use nuclear bombs, it would destory humanity as we know it. But this didn't stop both countries to test them. In order to stop USSR taking over countries and turing them into communist parties, NATO was created.</p> 
    <p>Then the Soviet Union started to explore space and see the military advantages that space had. The United States had realized that they have to do the same thing in order to beat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. But the problem was that the Soviets had already sent the first human and satellite. The US wasn't that far behind.</p> 
    <p>Then the US had come with an idea, a race to the moon. That is what John F. Kennedy realized. At first they thought of bombing the moon. They thought that this would scare the Soviets. Both this idea was dennied. Then came the idea of sending a man to the moon. Kennedy agreed and then gave his speech of how "We must put a man on the moon whithin the decade".</p> 
    <p>Kennedy shifted most of the governments budget to Nasa. Many people didn't agree with this idea at first, but they did later. Later, Nasa started the Genimi project to start to get information about space and to try to build rockets and capsules for Apollo.</p> 
    <p>Later on, for campaigning and giving a speech, Kennedy was in Dallas, Texas where in a car ride he was assassinated, alothough this is very controversial.</p> 
    <p>As years passes, Kennedy's deadline was comming close. The Soviets had secretly also started their own mission to try to put a man on the moon before the Americans did. Another advantage the Soviets had was that they already had a space station (MIR), this gave them more information than the Americans had.</p> 
    <p>As Nasa worked toward the goal, they were becoming more and more close to acheving it. They were orbiting the moon, did difficult mmaneuvers to put a man on the moon.</p> 
    <p>Then on July 16, 1969 the Saturn 5 liftoffed to go to the moon and to put a man on the moon. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped off the the Eagle and was the first man on the moon. The Cold War was over and the Soviets had lost. The empire was starting to become broke and soon after, the USSR had collapsed.</p>
