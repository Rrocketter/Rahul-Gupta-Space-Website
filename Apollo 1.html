    <p> Apollo 1 never actually took out and went to space. The mission of Apollo 1 was suppose to test the setup of the equipment going to be used when landing on the moon. Also, it was suppose to be the first Apollo mission in space. The crew for this mission was Gus Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee, and Ed White. Everything was normal for this crew. They were practicing for their flight and were sitting in a command module simulator.</p> 
    <p>As they were trying to communicate with Mission Control, they lost connection. Then suddenly a fire started in the cockpit. They tried to exit but the door/hatch was locked from outside. Then they tried to inform Mission Control about it. The message couldn't get through and the crew suffocated to death becuase of the fire. All crew members were killed and the Nasa held a ceromony for the crew members.</p> 
    <p>President Nixzon attened this ceremony to give honor to the crew members. After this tradegy, NASA rebuilt and checked to see what could've possibly started the fire and refixed its communication systems. It was found that damaged wires created the fire. Also, it was found that because of pure oxygen in that air, the fire escalated and killed the crew.
